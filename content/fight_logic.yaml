  I learn to box by attempting to execute punch combinations called out by a professional trainer. Simultaneously, a violinist listens to the same instructions, but plays them as musical notes.

  _Fight Logic_ is a companion piece to _Take Karaoke_, an installation and &ldquo;proposition for performance art&rdquo; by Wickerham and Lomax. It repeats logics that script the body and the performance of identity, dealing in the small failures between representation and execution.
