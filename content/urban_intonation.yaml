  Living under the paving stones, consuming our refuse, and incubating our diseases, the city rat is a ubiquitous part of global, urban capitalism. The revulsion rats inspire actually speaks of our closeness to themâ€”neither domesticated nor &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; _rattus norvegicus_ belies the notion that we are separate from nature. And just as we continually negotiate our place in a dynamic city, so have rats developed elaborate social codes intertwined with urban architecture and geography.

  We are not usually privy to the vocal address of one rat to another, however, as they primarily speak above the (20khz) threshold of human hearing. But for _Urban Intonation_, I recorded rats at multiple sites in NYC with a custom ultrasonic microphone that I left in their burrows for 24-hour periods. I then pitch-shifted the result into the human auditory range and mixed it for multi-channel playback over a human public address system, repositioning rat vocalizations as something that is recognizable, if not intelligible, as (political) communication.
