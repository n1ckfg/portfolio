  In _Arrangement for Building_, Modest Mussorgsky&rsquo;s _Pictures at an Exhibition_ is performed by a chamber orchestra from Cincinnati&rsquo;s College-Conservatory of Music. Though the musicians are perfectly synchronized in time via networked devices, they are spatially distributed throughout the Contemporary Arts Center building&mdash;they play not only on the distinctive zig-zag staircases and in the gallery spaces that open from floor to floor, but also in the administrative offices, the maintenance rooms, and other concealed areas that are nonetheless essential to the institution. The audience, while prevented from hearing the ensemble as a whole, is invited to roam, encountering intersections of sound as they traverse the space.
