  When visitors to the Center for Contemporary Art in Tel Aviv attempt to join the museum's wifi network, they are presented with a randomly selected message. The text is drawn from answers solicited online to the question, "What does the internet sound like?"

  Sound and the space in which it reverberates are inexorably linked. But online "space" is elusive, slipping between media, a sense of connection (or lack thereof), and infrastructure. How do we imagine this sound, if we could hear it? The alternately breathless and melancholy answers reflect our ambivalent relationship with contemporary digital life.
