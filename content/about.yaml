  stuck in the digital? it's the means, the medium, but is that what I'm still commenting on?
  Artist. Rhythms of the body, technology, and the environment. is that maybe ultimately more interesting? and accurate?
  Brian House is an artist whose performances, installations, and interventions explore the intersecting rhythms of the body, technology, and the environment.
  see, I just dont like the threes so much. but that's it. could lose interventions.

  the specific comment on technology is that it's typically considered separately from the other two.
  I use technology because that's where I come from, and in that I reflect my time. I'm interested in connecting it back.
  I'm interested in re-performance over metaphor, experience over representation.
  my projects are compositions + performances
  through which I make sense of the contested topics which interest me.
  Im often as interested in the network of relationships through which they come to be as I am in the result (research based practice)
  Im somewhat less interested in sprawling investigations than poetic statements. how do I reconcile that?

  expansively, those categories are meaningless -- all ensembles.

  His research-based process re-performs and/or contests the dynamics of emerging systems

  Small gestures

  those categories are unstable. 
  the rhythms that relate bodies, technologies, and the environment.

  who am I speaking for? whose body? _the_ body implies a neutral abstract. _our_ bodies is a little better? _my_ body is something, but inaccurate.
