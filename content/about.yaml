He's been a speaker at Eyeo Festival and Better World by Design.

  Currently, Brian is a fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. Previously, he was a member of the R&D Lab at the New York Times where his work was recognized by TIME in their "50 Best Inventions of 2011" issue. Brian has also led technology at the award-winning design studio Local Projects, developed interdisciplinary courses at RISD Digital+Media, Parsons Design & Technology, and at Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, and he has been an artist-in-residence at Eyebeam.
