  Brian House is an artist whose performances, installations, and interventions explore our material relationships with digital systems. This brings him into contact with things like artificial intelligence, urban ecology, telegraphy, and boxing. He favors sound over image. 

  Brian&rsquo;s work has been shown by MoMA (NYC), MOCA (LA), Ars Electronica, Transmediale, ZKM | Center for Art and Media, Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, Tel Aviv Center for Contemporary Art, and Rhizome, among others, and has been featured in publications including TIME, WIRED, The New York Times, Neural, Creative Applications, Hyperallergic, Creator&rsquo;s Project, and somewhat unexpectedly by Univision Sports.

  Brian is currently a PhD candidate at Brown University. Previously, he was a member of the R&amp;D Lab at the New York Times. He has also led technology at the award-winning design studio Local Projects and developed interdisciplinary courses at RISD Digital+Media, Parsons Design &amp; Technology, and at Columbia&rsquo;s Spatial Information Design Lab. He has been an artist-in-residence at Eyebeam, MassMOCA, and the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab, and a fellow at the TOW Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia. He comes from Denver and lives in Providence.

thoughts:
  stuck in the digital? it's the means, the medium, but is that what I'm still commenting on?
  Artist. Rhythms of the body, technology, and the environment. is that maybe ultimately more interesting? and accurate?

  see, I just dont like the threes so much. but that's it. could lose interventions.

  my projects are compositions + performances
  through which I make sense of the contested topics which interest me often as interested in the network of relationships through which they come to be as I am in the result (research based practice)
  the specific comment on technology is that it's considered separately from the other two.
  I use technology because that's where I come from, and in that I reflect my time. I'm interested in connecting it back.
  I'm interested in re-performance over metaphor, experience over representation.
