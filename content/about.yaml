  Brian House is an artist whose performances, installations, and interventions address the material articulation of time in data-driven culture. With a background in computer science, Brian's current practice-based doctoral research in music and media studies resituates Henri Lefebvre's _Rhythmanalysis_ in a contemporary context. It proposes that understanding digital media through embodied rhythm and sound is a means of overcoming the limits of representation and emphasizing a needed politics of ecological interdependence.
