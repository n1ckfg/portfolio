   It is the slippages that interest me, where representations fall short and the contingencies of the physical seep inâ€”points of failure, forgotten genealogies, unexpected interdependencies. 

   His projects each isolate a data-driven system and draw out, re-perform, or contest its constituent dynamics with specific attention to the human performance entangled within. 

   I have explored face recognition, black box recorders, audio surveillance, and telegraphy among many other technologies, and my current focus is artificial intelligence. In each case, I critically engage across multiple means of knowing, including the aesthetic, and my training as a computer scientist, artist, and humanities scholar grounds me in this regard.

   I work via an epistemology of "rhythm" that re-performs and/or contests the material dynamics of our data-driven systems.

   Brian House is an artist whose performances, installations, and interventions re-perform and/or contest the material dynamics of data-driven systems.
