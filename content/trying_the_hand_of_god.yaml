  A carefully choreographed, repeating reenactment allows participants to play the role of Diego Maradona, the Argentine soccer legend who scored the illegal but unpenalized &ldquo;Hand of God&rdquo; goal against England during the 1986 FIFA World Cup. The possibility of a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; performance inevitably remains elusive&mdash;rather, the repetitions are a form of kinetic media that contrasts YouTube&rsquo;s replays. TVs throughout the museum show the event as it is remade.
