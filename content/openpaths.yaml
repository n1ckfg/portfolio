  [OpenPaths](https://openpaths.cc) is a secure data locker for personal location information.

  We inhabit a world where data are being collected about us on a massive scale. These data are monetized by corporations and monitored by the state&mdash;the people whom the data actually purport to represent have little agency to use it for their own purposes. What if instead individuals could be conscious collaborators intiatives around public health, environmental justice, or urban planning?

  _OpenPaths_ demonstrates an alternative implementation of data infrastructure. Using the _OpenPaths_ mobile app you can track your location, visualize where you&rsquo;ve been, and download your data in a variety of friendly data formats. You can keep your location history to yourself, or you can share it with specific research initiatives, art projects, or educational programs as you so choose. Your data is always encrypted on the _OpenPaths_ servers, and cannot be accessed by anyone, including systems admins, without your express consent.
