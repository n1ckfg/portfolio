  Facebook uses face recognition software to identify its users in photos. This works via a &ldquo;template&rdquo; of your facial features&mdash;the distance between your eyes, the symmetry of your mouth&mdash;that generally do not change over time. Unlike a photograph, which captures some ephemeral expression of who you are at a particular moment, a face recognition template forever remains your portrait. It is all possible photos, taken and untaken, by which you, or someone else, might document your life.

  _Eternal Portraits_ is a series of printed and framed face recognition template data from our friends and ourselves. They are Facebook&rsquo;s proprietry data, legible only their machines.
