  Over a period of one year, I tracked the GPS location of 1000 anonymous volunteers in NYC, at all times, via a custom app they installed on their phones. I used these data to train an artificial intelligence algorithm similar to what is used for self-driving cars, realistic computer voices, predictive policing, and myriad other emerging applications (an LSTM recurrent neural network). The algorithm was subsequently able to generate a new path around NYC that synthesized the daily behaviors of all of the volunteers. 

  In the spirit of Vito Acconci&rsquo;s _Following Piece_ or Sophie Calle&rsquo;s _Suite V&eacute;nitienne_, I then followed the AI through the city for one week without stopping, using an app to get directions in real-time on my phone. I took photographs (with my phone) of the daily life I encountered and wrote in a journal.

  The intelligence of AI is not spontaneous, but socialized. It is uncanny not because it acts _as if_ it were human, but because it _is_ humans, plural. They may be subsumed into the whole, but this whole is a trace of its parts. A dataset of movement around the city means that trace is literal. By following it, will I find them?
