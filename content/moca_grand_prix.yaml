  In _MOCA Grand Prix_, Knifeandfork (Brian House and Sue Huang) invites participants to race remote-control cars through MOCA&rsquo;s permanent collection exhibition. Using mounted cameras, each Wifi-enabled car is driven remotely through a video game interface that shows the car&rsquo;s point of view. Through the lens of 1980s American gaming culture, this project offers an alternative perspective on the museum. Awards are presented for the fastest times of the evening.
