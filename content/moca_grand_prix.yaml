  In _MOCA Grand Prix_, game consoles in the plaza let participants race real remote control cars through MOCAâ€™s permanent collection exhibition. The wifi-enabled cars stream back images of Pollocks and Rothkos now appropriated for the background of a retro-style racing game. Awards are presented for the fastest times of the evening.
