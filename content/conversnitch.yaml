  _Conversnitch_ automatically tweets overheard conversations, bridging the gap between (presumed) private physical space and public space online.

  A small "lightbulb" plugs into any standard fixture, and via a microphone and wifi connection audio is streamed to Amazon's Mechanical Turk, where it is transcribed by anonymous workers and posted to Twitter.

  _Conversnitch_ complicates the divisions between the physical and virtual, illegal and playful, human and machine, spoken and textual, eavesdropping and illumination.
