  _Hundekopf_ uses the Ringbahn (Berlinâ€™s S-Bahn train route that encircles the city) as a literal vehicle for a text-message narrative that investigates the nature of private experience in public space.

  After texting a phone number printed on flyers distributed through the city, a participant is told to board a specific train arriving in the next few minutes. Once on the train, _Hundekopf_ knows the location of the participant because it scrapes train times from the BVG alert system [Ed. note: this is before GPS in phones]. Participants receive a message after each station they pass on their way around the Ringbahn that is place-specific, and both the landscape outside of the train and the passengers within it are recontextualized into the narrative.

  _Hundekopf_ is a (possibly) fictional resistance organization, a conduit for the unseen in the everyday.
