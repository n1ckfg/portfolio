  _Hundekopf_ uses Berlin&rsquo;s Ringbahn as a literary (and literal) vehicle to investigate the nature of private experience in public space. After texting a phone number printed on flyers distributed throughout the city, a participant is told to board a specific train arriving in the next few minutes. Once on the train, _Hundekopf_ knows the location of the participant because it scrapes train times from the BVG alert system [Ed. note: this is before GPS in phones]. Participants receive a text-message after they pass each station on their way around the Ringbahn that is place-specific, and both the landscape outside of the train and the passengers within it are recontextualized into the narrative.

  _Hundekopf_ is a (possibly) fictional resistance organization, a conduit for the unseen in the everyday.
