  _Tanglr_ is an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tanglr/anhpnanphhhphafiblilbggemelijnpn) for Google Chrome which, when activated, anonymously links you with another person. When you browse, your partner is taken to the same urls. Likewise, when your partner browses, your browser changes to what they&rsquo;re seeing. The two of you have to work it out together.
