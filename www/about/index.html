<div class="about text">
    <p>Brian House is an artist whose performances, installations, and interventions address the poetics and politics of time in digital culture. His work is informed both by his background in computer science and a preoccupation with the immediacy and relationality of sound.</p>
<p>He has exhibited in museums and galleries including MoMA (NYC), MOCA (LA), Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, Tel Aviv Center for Contemporary Art, Stockholm's Kulturhuset, Science Gallery Dublin, and Karlsruhe's Center for Art and Media, featured at festivals including Ars Electronica, ISEA, NIME, and Conflux, and performed at venues such as Issue Project Room, Platoon Kunsthalle Seoul, and The Stone. TIME, WIRED, The New York Times, Neural, Metropolis, and Univision Sports have featured his work, as has Creative Applications, Create Digital Music, and the Guardian online.</p>
<p>Previously, Brian was a member of the R&amp;D Lab at the New York Times where his work was recognized by TIME in their "50 Best Inventions of 2011" issue. Brian has also led technology at the award-winning design studio Local Projects, developed interdisciplinary courses at RISD Digital+Media, Parsons Design &amp; Technology, and at Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture. He has been an artist-in-residence at Eyebeam, MassMOCA, and the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab, and a fellow at the TOW Center for Digital Journalism. In 2015, Brian participated in a National Geographic-funded transect of the Okavango river system in central Africa as a technologist and sound recordist.</p>
<p>Brian holds degrees in computer science, art, and media studies and is a PhD candidate at Brown University. He comes from Denver and lives in Providence.</p>
