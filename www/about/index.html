    <p>Brian House is an artist whose work explores the interdependent rhythms of the body, technology, and the environment. His background in both computer science and noise rock informs his research-based practice. Recent interests include AI, telegraphy, and urban rats. </p>
<p>Brian&rsquo;s work has been shown by MoMA (NYC), MOCA (LA), Ars Electronica, Transmediale, ZKM | Center for Art and Media, Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, Tel Aviv Center for Contemporary Art, and Rhizome, among others, and has been featured in publications including TIME, WIRED, The New York Times, Neural, Creative Applications, Hyperallergic, Creator&rsquo;s Project, and somewhat unexpectedly by Univision Sports.</p>
<p>Brian is currently a PhD candidate at Brown University. Previously, he was a member of the R&amp;D Lab at the New York Times. He has also led technology at the award-winning design studio Local Projects and developed interdisciplinary courses at RISD Digital+Media, Parsons Design &amp; Technology, and at Columbia&rsquo;s Spatial Information Design Lab. He has been an artist-in-residence at Eyebeam, MassMOCA, and the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab, and a fellow at the TOW Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia. He comes from Denver and lives in Providence.</p>
